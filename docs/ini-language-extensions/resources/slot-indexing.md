# Slot Indexing

Pipeline slot targets such as `ps-t0` or `vb1` use a fixed slot number. **XXMI DLL** allows the slot number to be an expression evaluated at runtime, and allows a range of slots to be bound or fetched by a single operation.

## Dynamic Slot Index

### `<slot>[$index]`

The slot number is given as an expression in square brackets and evaluated every time the line runs.

```ini
ps-t[$index] = ref ResourceFoo
ResourceBar = ref vs-cb[$index + 1]
```

Supported slot types:

| Syntax            | Slot Type                                  | Valid Index |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `<stage>-t[$i]`   | Shader resource                            | `0`–`127`   |
| `<stage>-u[$i]`   | Unordered access view (`ps` and `cs` only) | `0`–`63`    |
| `<stage>-cb[$i]`  | Constant buffer                            | `0`–`13`    |
| `vb[$i]`          | Vertex buffer                              | `0`–`31`    |
| `o[$i]`           | Render target                              | `0`–`7`     |
| `so[$i]`          | Stream output                              | `0`–`3`     |

`<stage>` is one of `vs`, `hs`, `ds`, `gs`, `ps` or `cs`.

The index is truncated to an integer. An index outside the valid range logs a warning and the operation is skipped.

A dynamic slot index is accepted anywhere a pipeline slot is, including `CheckTextureOverride`, `dump` and expressions:

```ini
CheckTextureOverride = ps-t[$index]
$resource_id = @ps-t[$index]
$size = ps-t[$index]->Size
```

> [Input layout](../input-layouts/README.md) overrides require a fixed slot, so `vb[$index]->ElementFormat(...)` is not supported.

## Slot Ranges

### `<slot>[$first:$last]`

Selects slots `$first` through `$last`, inclusive. Both bounds are expressions evaluated at runtime.

Ranges are supported for `t` and `cb` slots of every shader stage, and for `ps-u` and `cs-u` slots. The whole range is processed by a single D3D11 call, such as `PSSetShaderResources`, which is significantly cheaper than binding the slots one by one.

A slot range is used in a resource copy with a pool, a custom resource or `null` on the other side:

```ini
ps-t[0:9] = ref PoolFoo[0:9]  ; Bind pool elements 0–9 to ps-t0–ps-t9
PoolFoo[0:9] = ref ps-t[0:9]  ; Fetch ps-t0–ps-t9 into pool elements 0–9
PoolFoo[0:9] = copy ps-t[0:9] ; Copy ps-t0–ps-t9 into pool elements 0–9
ps-t[0:3] = ref ResourceFoo   ; Bind the same resource to ps-t0–ps-t3
ps-t[0:3] = null              ; Unbind ps-t0–ps-t3
```

When the copy type is omitted, the usual 3DMigoto rules apply: binding a custom resource to a slot is a `ref`, fetching a slot into a custom resource is a `copy`.

Slot bounds are validated at runtime: `$first` must not be negative, `$last` must not be smaller than `$first`, and `$last` must be a valid slot number. An invalid range logs a warning and the operation is skipped.

### Pool Ranges

`PoolFoo[$first:$last]` selects pool elements `$first` through `$last`, inclusive.

Pool bounds follow [Ring indexing](../pools/indexing.md/#ring-indexing) rules, so negative and overflowing indices wrap around the pool size. The range may not be larger than the pool.

This holds for every index type: on a `fifo` or `spatial` pool the bounds are still element indices, not keys, so the range addresses the physical elements directly and bypasses key lookup. Element keys are not touched by a range operation. A fetch counts as an update of the elements it writes for [expiration](../pools/declaration.md/#element-expiration) purposes, like any assignment.

A pool range is only valid on the other side of a slot range. Each side states its own bounds, so that a range is visible in the line without reading the other side of the assignment, and the two ranges must have the same size.

### Copy Options

Slot ranges accept the same copy types and options as a single-slot copy, such as `copy`, `unless_null`, `no_view_cache`, `raw` or `resolve_msaa`.

* `unless_null` — slots whose source is `null` keep their current binding, and pool elements whose source slot is empty are left untouched, including their [expiration](../pools/declaration.md/#element-expiration): a skipped element does not count as updated.
* `no_view_cache` — views created for the range are released after each run instead of being cached per slot.

A plain `ref` (optionally with `unless_null` and `no_view_cache`) is the fast path: the range only resolves views and issues one bind or fetch call. When a pool element already holds a view of the slot's type, for example because it was fetched from a slot of the same type, that view is bound directly instead of creating a new one.

Any other copy type or option runs a regular single-slot copy per slot, exactly as the equivalent `ps-tN = copy ...` line would, and only the final bind call is shared. A `copy` into constant buffer slots binds each slot separately, since the copied region has to be bound with `XXSetConstantBuffers1`.

### Frame Analysis Log

The frame analysis log lists every slot of the range as the equivalent single-slot line, e.g. `ps-t3 = ref PoolFoo_3`, with the copy details nested under it for `copy` operations.

### Frame Analysis Dump

`dump` accepts a slot range or a pool range and dumps each slot or element in turn. The slot number or element index is appended to the dump file name.

```ini
dump = ps-t[0:3]
dump = PoolFoo[0:3]
```

Dumping a pool element does not count as updating it, so it does not postpone [expiration](../pools/declaration.md/#element-expiration). A whole pool (`dump = PoolFoo`) has no resource of its own to dump.

### CheckTextureOverride

`CheckTextureOverride` accepts a slot range or a pool range and checks each slot or element in turn, exactly as the equivalent single lines would. Inside the matched `[TextureOverride*]` sections, `this` refers to the slot or element being checked.

```ini
CheckTextureOverride = ps-t[0:9]  ; Same as CheckTextureOverride = ps-t0 ... ps-t9
CheckTextureOverride = PoolFoo[0:3]
```

A single pool element, `CheckTextureOverride = PoolFoo[$i]`, works as any custom resource does. Checking an element does not count as updating it either. A whole pool (`CheckTextureOverride = PoolFoo`) has no resource of its own to check. Commands other than `dump` and `CheckTextureOverride` do not accept ranges.

## Examples

* [Slot Range Capture](../examples/slot-range-capture.md) — save, rebind and restore a range of slots through a pool
* [Slot Scan](../examples/slot-scan.md) — loop over slots with a dynamic slot index
